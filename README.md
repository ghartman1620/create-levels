this is the current repo for my assignment 3, creating levels, for CMPM147 at UCSC.

Currently called "create-paths" as a placeholder name.

Download and unzip the target archive to run the latest build.

This repo currently only contains source files, found in assets. I'm currently unsure what should be included in the repo for such a project, but if you're unable to clone into a unity project let me know what additional content is needed.
